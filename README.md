# crudapp
Full CRUD app leveraging Express, Nodejs, EJS, MongoDB and Mongoose as the stack. 
I chose to sharpen up my CSS skills instead of using a CSS framework. 
Things I would change about this project:
-Add a shopping cart functionality to the site utilizing a second Schema and database. 
-Adjust the background to make it fit the user's screen fully instead of repeating.
