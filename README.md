# crudapp
Full CRUD app leveraging Express, Nodejs, EJS, MongoDB and Mongoose as the stack. <br>
I chose to sharpen up my CSS skills instead of using a CSS framework. <br>
<b>Things I would change about this project:</b> <br>
-Add a shopping cart functionality to the site utilizing a second Schema and database. <br>
-Adjust the background to make it fit the user's screen fully instead of repeating. <br>
